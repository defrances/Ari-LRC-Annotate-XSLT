To strengthen program integrity and reduce improper payments of unemployment compensation by States through the detection and prevention of such payments to individuals who are not eligible for such compensation. To promote alignment with the broader vision of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) of increased program integration and service delivery for job seekers, including claimants for unemployment compensation. To establish reemployment services and eligibility assessments as an entry point for individuals receiving unemployment compensation into other workforce system partner programs.In carrying out a State program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments using grant funds awarded to the State under this section, a State shall use such funds only for interventions demonstrated to reduce the number of weeks for which program participants receive unemployment compensation by improving employment outcomes for program participants.In addition to the requirement imposed by paragraph (1), a State shall— for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, use no less than 25 percent of the grant funds awarded to the State under this section for interventions with a high or moderate causal evidence rating that show a demonstrated capacity to improve employment and earnings outcomes for program participants; for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, use no less than 40 percent of such grant funds for interventions described in subparagraph (A); and for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 2026, use no less than 50 percent of such grant funds for interventions described in subparagraph (A).Any intervention without a high or moderate causal evidence rating used by a State in carrying out a State program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments under this section shall be under evaluation at the time of use.A State shall use not more than 10 percent of grant funds awarded to the State under this section to conduct or cause to be conducted evaluations of interventions used in carrying out a program under this section (including evaluations conducted pursuant to paragraph (1)).As a condition of eligibility to receive a grant under this section for a fiscal year, a State shall submit to the Secretary, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require, a State plan that outlines how the State intends to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments under this section, including— assurances that, and a description of how, the program will provide— proper notification to participating individuals of the program’s eligibility conditions, requirements, and benefits, including the issuance of warnings and simple, clear notifications to ensure that participating individuals are fully aware of the consequences of failing to adhere to such requirements, including policies related to non-attendance or non-fulfillment of work search requirements; and reasonable scheduling accommodations to maximize participation for eligible individuals; assurances that, and a description of how, the program will conform with the purposes outlined in subsection (b) and satisfy the requirement to use evidence-based standards under subsection (c), including— a description of the evidence-based interventions the State plans to use to speed reemployment; an explanation of how such interventions are appropriate to the population served; and if applicable, a description of the evaluation structure the State plans to use for interventions without at least a moderate or high causal evidence rating, which may include national evaluations conducted by the Department of Labor or by other entities; and a description of any reemployment activities and evaluations conducted in the prior fiscal year, and any data collected on— characteristics of program participants; the number of weeks for which program participants receive unemployment compensation; and employment and other outcomes for program participants consistent with State performance accountability measures provided by the State unemployment compensation program and in section 116(b) of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3141(b)).The Secretary shall approve any State plan, that is timely submitted to the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may require, that satisfies the conditions described in paragraph (1).If the Secretary determines that a State plan submitted pursuant to this subsection fails to satisfy the conditions described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall— disapprove such plan; provide to the State, not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the State plan, a written notice of such disapproval that includes a description of any portion of the plan that was not approved and the reason for the disapproval of each such portion; and provide the State with an opportunity to correct any such failure and submit a revised State plan.For each fiscal year after fiscal year 2020, the Secretary shall allocate a percentage equal to the base funding percentage for such fiscal year of the funds made available for grants under this section among the States awarded such a grant for such fiscal year using a formula prescribed by the Secretary based on the rate of insured unemployment (as defined in section 203(e)(1) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note)) in the State for a period to be determined by the Secretary. In developing such formula with respect to a State, the Secretary shall consider the importance of avoiding sharp reductions in grant funding to a State over time.For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term 'base funding percentage' means— for fiscal years 2021 through 2026, 89 percent; and for fiscal years after 2026, 84 percent.Of the amounts made available for grants under this section for each fiscal year after 2020, the Secretary shall reserve a percentage equal to the outcome reservation percentage for such fiscal year for outcome payments to increase the amount otherwise awarded to a State under paragraph (1). Such outcome payments shall be paid to States conducting reemployment services and eligibility assessments under this section that, during the previous fiscal year, met or exceeded the outcome goals provided in subsection (b)(1) related to reducing the average duration of receipt of unemployment compensation by improving employment outcomes.For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term 'outcome reservation percentage' means— for fiscal years 2021 through 2026, 10 percent; and for fiscal years after 2026, 15 percent.Of the amounts made available for grants under this section for each fiscal year after 2020, the Secretary may reserve not more than 1 percent to conduct research and provide technical assistance to States.Not later than September 30, 2019, the Secretary shall— consult with the States and seek public comment in developing the allocation formula under paragraph (1) and the criteria for carrying out the reservations under paragraph (2); and make publicly available the allocation formula and criteria developed pursuant to subclause (A).Not later than 90 days prior to making any changes to the allocation formula or the criteria developed pursuant to subsection (f)(5)(A), the Secretary shall submit to Congress, including to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, a notification of any such change.Funds made available to carry out this section shall be used to supplement the level of Federal, State, and local public funds that, in the absence of such availability, would be expended to provide reemployment services and eligibility assessments to individuals receiving unemployment compensation, and in no case to supplant such Federal, State, or local public funds.In this section:The terms 'high causal evidence rating' and 'moderate causal evidence rating' shall have the meaning given such terms by the Secretary of Labor.The term 'eligible State' means a State that has in effect a State plan approved by the Secretary in accordance with subsection (e).The term 'intervention' means a service delivery strategy for the provision of State reemployment services and eligibility assessment activities under this section.The term 'State' has the meaning given the term in section 205 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note).The term unemployment compensation means 'regular compensation', 'extended compensation', and 'additional compensation' (as such terms are defined by section 205 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note)).''.","cardTarget":"/uslm/us/usc/t42/s501...","xml":"<subsection

sequestration credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of— $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide which is— captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage and not used by the taxpayer as described in paragraph (2)(B), $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide which is— captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in subsection (f)(5), the applicable dollar amount (as determined under subsection (b)(1)) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide which is— captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service, and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage and not used by the taxpayer as described in paragraph (4)(B), and the applicable dollar amount (as determined under subsection (b)(1)) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide which is— captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service, and used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in subsection (f)(5).The applicable dollar amount shall be an amount equal to— for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2016 and before 2027— for purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (a), the dollar amount established by linear interpolation between $22.66 and $50 for each calendar year during such period, and for purposes of paragraph (4) of such subsection, the dollar amount established by linear interpolation between $12.83 and $35 for each calendar year during such period, and for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026— for purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (a), an amount equal to the product of $50 and the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for such calendar year, determined by substituting '2025' for '1990', and for purposes of paragraph (4) of such subsection, an amount equal to the product of $35 and the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for such calendar year, determined by substituting '2025' for '1990'.The applicable dollar amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be rounded to the nearest cent.In the case of a qualified facility placed in service before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, for which additional carbon capture equipment is placed in service on or after the date of the enactment of such Act, the amount of qualified carbon oxide which is captured by the taxpayer shall be equal to— for purposes of paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A) of subsection (a), the lesser of— the total amount of qualified carbon oxide captured at such facility for the taxable year, or the total amount of the carbon dioxide capture capacity of the carbon capture equipment in service at such facility on the day before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and for purposes of paragraphs (3)(A) and (4)(A) of such subsection, an amount (not less than zero) equal to the excess of— the amount described in clause (i) of subparagraph (A), over the amount described in clause (ii) of such subparagraph.For purposes of determining the carbon oxide sequestration credit under this section, a taxpayer may elect to have the dollar amounts applicable under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) apply in lieu of the dollar amounts applicable under paragraph (3) or (4) of such subsection for each metric ton of qualified carbon oxide which is captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.For purposes of this section—The term 'qualified carbon oxide' means— any carbon dioxide which— is captured from an industrial source by carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as industrial emission of greenhouse gas or lead to such release, and is measured at the source of capture and verified at the point of disposal, injection, or utilization, any carbon dioxide or other carbon oxide which— is captured from an industrial source by carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service on or after the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as industrial emission of greenhouse gas or lead to such release, and is measured at the source of capture and verified at the point of disposal, injection, or utilization, or in the case of a direct air capture facility, any carbon dioxide which— is captured directly from the ambient air, and is measured at the source of capture and verified at the point of disposal, injection, or utilization.The term 'qualified carbon oxide' includes the initial deposit of captured carbon oxide used as a tertiary injectant. Such term does not include carbon oxide that is recaptured, recycled, and re-injected as part of the enhanced oil and natural gas recovery process.For purposes of this section, the term 'qualified facility' means any industrial facility or direct air capture facility— the construction of which begins before January 1, 2024, and— construction of carbon capture equipment begins before such date, or the original planning and design for such facility includes installation of carbon capture equipment, and which captures— in the case of a facility which emits not more than 500,000 metric tons of carbon oxide into the atmosphere during the taxable year, not less than 25,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide during the taxable year which is utilized in a manner described in subsection (f)(5), in the case of an electricity generating facility which is not described in subparagraph (A), not less than 500,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide during the taxable year, or in the case of a direct air capture facility or any facility not described in subparagraph (A) or (B), not less than 100,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide during the taxable year.For purposes of this section—Subject to subparagraph (B), the term 'direct air capture facility' means any facility which uses carbon capture equipment to capture carbon dioxide directly from the ambient air.The term 'direct air capture facility' shall not include any facility which captures carbon dioxide— which is deliberately released from naturally occurring subsurface springs, or using natural photosynthesis.The term 'qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project' has the meaning given the term 'qualified enhanced oil recovery project' by section 43(c)(2), by substituting 'crude oil or natural gas' for 'crude oil' in subparagraph (A)(i) thereof.The term 'tertiary injectant' has the same meaning as when used within section 193(b)(1).The credit under this section shall apply only with respect to qualified carbon oxide the capture and disposal, use, or utilization of which is within— the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1)), or a possession of the United States (within the meaning of section 638(2)).The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior, shall establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of qualified carbon oxide under subsection (a) such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Such term shall include storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.Except as provided in subparagraph (B) or in any regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any credit under this section shall be attributable to— in the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the person that captures and physically or contractually ensures the disposal, utilization, or use as a tertiary injectant of such qualified carbon oxide, and in the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the person that owns the carbon capture equipment and physically or contractually ensures the capture and disposal, utilization, or use as a tertiary injectant of such qualified carbon oxide.If the person described in subparagraph (A) makes an election under this subparagraph in such time and manner as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations, the credit under this section— shall be allowable to the person that disposes of the qualified carbon oxide, utilizes the qualified carbon oxide, or uses the qualified carbon oxide as a tertiary injectant, and shall not be allowable to the person described in subparagraph (A).The Secretary shall, by regulations, provide for recapturing the benefit of any credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any qualified carbon oxide which ceases to be captured, disposed of, or used as a tertiary injectant in a manner consistent with the requirements of this section.For purposes of this section, utilization of qualified carbon oxide means— the fixation of such qualified carbon oxide through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, such as through the growing of algae or bacteria, the chemical conversion of such qualified carbon oxide to a material or chemical compound in which such qualified carbon oxide is securely stored, or the use of such qualified carbon oxide for any other purpose for which a commercial market exists (with the exception of use as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project), as determined by the Secretary.For purposes of determining the amount of qualified carbon oxide utilized by the taxpayer under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) or (4)(B)(ii) of subsection (a), such amount shall be equal to the metric tons of qualified carbon oxide which the taxpayer demonstrates, based upon an analysis of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and subject to such requirements as the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, determines appropriate, were— captured and permanently isolated from the atmosphere, or displaced from being emitted into the atmosphere,For purposes of clause (i), the term 'lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions' has the same meaning given such term under subparagraph (H) of section 211(o)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)), as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, except that 'product' shall be substituted for 'fuel' each place it appears in such subparagraph.For purposes of this section, in the case of an applicable facility, for any taxable year in which such facility captures not less than 500,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide during the taxable year, the person described in paragraph (3)(A)(ii) may elect to have such facility, and any carbon capture equipment placed in service at such facility, deemed as having been placed in service on the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'applicable facility' means a qualified facility— which was placed in service before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and for which no taxpayer claimed a credit under this section in regards to such facility for any taxable year ending before the date of the enactment of such Act.In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2009, there shall be substituted for each dollar amount contained in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) an amount equal to the product of— such dollar amount, multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for such calendar year, determined by substituting '2008' for '1990'.In the case of any carbon capture equipment placed in service before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the credit under this section shall apply with respect to qualified carbon oxide captured using such equipment before the end of the calendar year in which the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, certifies that, during the period beginning after October 3, 2008, a total of 75,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide have been taken into account in accordance with— subsection (a) of this section, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section.The Secretary may prescribe such regulations and other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this section, including regulations or other guidance to— ensure proper allocation under subsection (a) for qualified carbon oxide captured by a taxpayer during the taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and determine whether a facility satisfies the requirements under subsection (d)(1) during such taxable year.''.","cardTarget":"","label":"dD tII

Such system shall be designed to collect information— needed to evaluate the extent to which reported costs relate to payment rates under this subsection; on the utilization of capital equipment and ambulance capacity, including information consistent with the type of information described in section 1121(a); and on different types of ground ambulance services furnished in different geographic locations, including rural areas and low population density areas described in paragraph (12).The Secretary shall— not later than December 31, 2019, specify the data collection system under subparagraph (A); and identify the providers and suppliers of ground ambulance services that would be required to submit information under such data collection system, including the representative sample described in clause (ii).Not later than December 31, 2019, with respect to the data collection for the first year under such system, and for each subsequent year through 2024, the Secretary shall determine a representative sample to submit information under the data collection system.The sample under subclause (I) shall be representative of the different types of providers and suppliers of ground ambulance services (such as those providers and suppliers that are part of an emergency service or part of a government organization) and the geographic locations in which ground ambulance services are furnished (such as urban, rural, and low population density areas).The Secretary shall not include an individual provider or supplier of ground ambulance services in the sample under subclause (I) in 2 consecutive years, to the extent practicable.For each year, a provider or supplier of ground ambulance services identified by the Secretary under subparagraph (B)(i)(II) as being required to submit information under the data collection system with respect to a period for the year shall submit to the Secretary information specified under the system. Such information shall be submitted in a form and manner, and at a time, specified by the Secretary for purposes of this subparagraph.Beginning January 1, 2022, subject to clause (ii), a 10 percent reduction to payments under this subsection shall be made for the applicable period (as defined in clause (ii)) to a provider or supplier of ground ambulance services that— is required to submit information under the data collection system with respect to a period under subparagraph (C); and does not sufficiently submit such information, as determined by the Secretary.For purposes of clause (i), the term 'applicable period' means, with respect to a provider or supplier of ground ambulance services, a year specified by the Secretary not more than 2 years after the end of the period with respect to which the Secretary has made a determination under clause (i)(II) that the provider or supplier of ground ambulance services failed to sufficiently submit information under the data collection system.The Secretary may exempt a provider or supplier from the payment reduction under clause (i) with respect to an applicable period in the event of significant hardship, such as a natural disaster, bankruptcy, or other similar situation that the Secretary determines interfered with the ability of the provider or supplier of ground ambulance services to submit such information in a timely manner for the specified period.The Secretary shall establish a process under which a provider or supplier of ground ambulance services may seek an informal review of a determination that the provider or supplier is subject to the payment reduction under clause (i).The Secretary may, as the Secretary determines appropriate and, if available, taking into consideration the report (or reports) under subparagraph (F), revise the data collection system under subparagraph (A).In order to continue to evaluate the extent to which reported costs relate to payment rates under this subsection and for other purposes the Secretary deems appropriate, the Secretary shall require providers and suppliers of ground ambulance services to submit information for years after 2024 as the Secretary determines appropriate, but in no case less often than once every 3 years.Not later than March 15, 2023, and as determined necessary by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission thereafter, such Commission shall assess, and submit to Congress a report on, information submitted by providers and suppliers of ground ambulance services through the data collection system under subparagraph (A), the adequacy of payments for ground ambulance services under this subsection, and geographic variations in the cost of furnishing such services.A report under clause (i) shall contain the following: An analysis of information submitted through the data collection system. An analysis of any burden on providers and suppliers of ground ambulance services associated with the data collection system. A recommendation as to whether information should continue to be submitted through such data collection system or if such system should be revised under subparagraph (E)(i). Other information determined appropriate by the Commission.The Secretary shall post information on the results of the data collection under this paragraph on the Internet website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.The Secretary shall implement this paragraph through notice and comment rulemaking.Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, shall not apply to the collection of information required under this subsection.There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1869, section 1878, or otherwise of the data collection system or identification of respondents under this paragraph.For purposes of carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall provide for the transfer, from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1841, of $15,000,000 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account for fiscal year 2018.

Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 710) is amended to read as follows:For the purpose described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall, for each of fiscal years 2018 and 2019, allot to each State which has transmitted an application for the fiscal year under section 505(a) an amount equal to the product of— the amount appropriated pursuant to subsection (e)(1) for the fiscal year, minus the amount reserved under subsection (e)(2) for the fiscal year; and the proportion that the number of low-income children in the State bears to the total of such numbers of children for all the States.For the purpose described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall, for each of fiscal years 2018 and 2019, for any State which has not transmitted an application for the fiscal year under section 505(a), allot to one or more entities in the State the amount that would have been allotted to the State under paragraph (1) if the State had submitted such an application.The Secretary shall select the recipients of allotments under subparagraph (A) by means of a competitive grant process under which— not later than 30 days after the deadline for the State involved to submit an application for the fiscal year under section 505(a), the Secretary publishes a notice soliciting grant applications; and not later than 120 days after such deadline, all such applications must be submitted.Except for research under paragraph (5) and information collection and reporting under paragraph (6), the purpose of an allotment under subsection (a) to a State (or to another entity in the State pursuant to subsection (a)(2)) is to enable the State or other entity to implement education exclusively on sexual risk avoidance (meaning voluntarily refraining from sexual activity).Education on sexual risk avoidance pursuant to an allotment under this section shall— ensure that the unambiguous and primary emphasis and context for each topic described in paragraph (3) is a message to youth that normalizes the optimal health behavior of avoiding nonmarital sexual activity; be medically accurate and complete; be age-appropriate; be based on adolescent learning and developmental theories for the age group receiving the education; and be culturally appropriate, recognizing the experiences of youth from diverse communities, backgrounds, and experiences.Education on sexual risk avoidance pursuant to an allotment under this section shall address each of the following topics: The holistic individual and societal benefits associated with personal responsibility, self-regulation, goal setting, healthy decisionmaking, and a focus on the future. The advantage of refraining from nonmarital sexual activity in order to improve the future prospects and physical and emotional health of youth. The increased likelihood of avoiding poverty when youth attain self-sufficiency and emotional maturity before engaging in sexual activity. The foundational components of healthy relationships and their impact on the formation of healthy marriages and safe and stable families. How other youth risk behaviors, such as drug and alcohol usage, increase the risk for teen sex. How to resist and avoid, and receive help regarding, sexual coercion and dating violence, recognizing that even with consent teen sex remains a youth risk behavior.Education on sexual risk avoidance pursuant to an allotment under this section shall ensure that— any information provided on contraception is medically accurate and complete and ensures that students understand that contraception offers physical risk reduction, but not risk elimination; and the education does not include demonstrations, simulations, or distribution of contraceptive devices.A State or other entity receiving an allotment pursuant to subsection (a) may use up to 20 percent of such allotment to build the evidence base for sexual risk avoidance education by conducting or supporting research.Any research conducted or supported pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be— rigorous; evidence-based; and designed and conducted by independent researchers who have experience in conducting and publishing research in peer-reviewed outlets.A State or other entity receiving an allotment pursuant to subsection (a) shall, as specified by the Secretary— collect information on the programs and activities funded through the allotment; and submit reports to the Secretary on the data from such programs and activities.The Secretary shall— in consultation with appropriate State and local agencies, conduct one or more rigorous evaluations of the education funded through this section and associated data; and submit a report to the Congress on the results of such evaluations, together with a summary of the information collected pursuant to subsection (b)(6).In conducting the evaluations required by paragraph (1), including the establishment of rigorous evaluation methodologies, the Secretary shall consult with relevant stakeholders and evaluation experts. Sections 503, 507, and 508 apply to allotments under subsection (a) to the same extent and in the same manner as such sections apply to allotments under section 502(c). Sections 505 and 506 apply to allotments under subsection (a) to the extent determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.In this section: The term 'age-appropriate' means suitable (in terms of topics, messages, and teaching methods) to the developmental and social maturity of the particular age or age group of children or adolescents, based on developing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral capacity typical for the age or age group. The term 'medically accurate and complete' means verified or supported by the weight of research conducted in compliance with accepted scientific methods and— published in peer-reviewed journals, where applicable; or comprising information that leading professional organizations and agencies with relevant expertise in the field recognize as accurate, objective, and complete. The term 'rigorous', with respect to research or evaluation, means using— established scientific methods for measuring the impact of an intervention or program model in changing behavior (specifically sexual activity or other sexual risk behaviors), or reducing pregnancy, among youth; or other evidence-based methodologies established by the Secretary for purposes of this section. The term 'youth' refers to one or more individuals who have attained age 10 but not age 20.To carry out this section, there is appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $75,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018 and 2019.The Secretary shall reserve, for each of fiscal years 2018 and 2019, not more than 20 percent of the amount appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) for administering the program under this section, including the conducting of national evaluations and the provision of technical assistance to the recipients of allotments.''.","cardTarget":"/uslm/us/usc/t42/s710","label":"dE tV 50502(a)","billpage":"161","author":"auto","treeLevel":4,"targetSection":"t42/s710 gen

An assurance that the State will report to the Secretary such information and data as the Secretary may require with respect to the provision of services and programs specified in paragraph (1), including information and data necessary to determine the performance measures for the State under paragraph (6) and compliance with paragraph (7).Except as provided in subclause (ii), a State may not receive a Federal payment under this part for a given promising, supported, or well-supported practice unless (in accordance with subparagraph (B)(iii)(V)) the plan includes a well-designed and rigorous evaluation strategy for that practice.The Secretary may waive the requirement for a well-designed and rigorous evaluation of any well-supported practice if the Secretary deems the evidence of the effectiveness of the practice to be compelling and the State meets the continuous quality improvement requirements included in subparagraph (B)(iii)(II) with regard to the practice.Beginning with fiscal year 2021, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall establish the following prevention services measures based on information and data reported by States that elect to provide services and programs specified in paragraph (1):The percentage of candidates for foster care for whom, or on whose behalf, the services or programs are provided who do not enter foster care, including those placed with a kin caregiver outside of foster care, during the 12-month period in which the services or programs are provided and through the end of the succeeding 12-month period.The total amount of expenditures made for mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services or in-home parent skill-based programs, respectively, for, or on behalf of, each child described in paragraph (2).The Secretary shall establish and annually update the prevention services measures— based on the median State values of the information reported under each clause of subparagraph (A) for the 3 then most recent years; and taking into account State differences in the price levels of consumption goods and services using the most recent regional price parities published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce or such other data as the Secretary determines appropriate.The Secretary shall annually make available to the public the prevention services measures of each State.If a State elects to provide services and programs specified in paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the State foster care prevention expenditures for the fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the expenditures for fiscal year 2014 (or, at the option of a State described in subparagraph (E), fiscal year 2015 or fiscal year 2016 (whichever the State elects)).The term 'State foster care prevention expenditures' means the following:State expenditures for foster care prevention services and activities under the State program funded under part A (including from amounts made available by the Federal Government), under the State plan developed under part B (including any such amounts), or under the Social Services Block Grant Programs under subtitle A of title XX (including any such amounts).State expenditures for foster care prevention services and activities under any State program that is not described in clause (i) (other than any State expenditures for foster care prevention services and activities under the State program under this part (including under a waiver of the program)).The term 'State expenditures' means all State or local funds that are expended by the State or a local agency including State or local funds that are matched or reimbursed by the Federal Government and State or local funds that are not matched or reimbursed by the Federal Government.The Secretary shall require each State that elects to provide services and programs specified in paragraph (1) to report the expenditures specified in subparagraph (B) for fiscal year 2014 and for such fiscal years thereafter as are necessary to determine whether the State is complying with the maintenance of effort requirement in subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall specify the specific services and activities under each program referred to in subparagraph (B) that are 'prevention services and activities' for purposes of the reports.For purposes of subparagraph (A), a State is described in this subparagraph if the population of children in the State in 2014 was less than 200,000 (as determined by the United States Census Bureau).A State that elects to provide services and programs specified in paragraph (1) shall not use any State foster care prevention expenditures for a fiscal year for the State share of expenditures under section 474(a)(6) for a fiscal year.Expenditures described in section 474(a)(6)(B)— shall not be eligible for payment under subparagraph (A), (B), or (E) of section 474(a)(3); and shall be eligible for payment under section 474(a)(6)(B) without regard to whether the expenditures are incurred on behalf of a child who is, or is potentially, eligible for foster care maintenance payments under this part.The provision of services or programs under this subsection to or on behalf of a child described in paragraph (2) shall not be considered to be receipt of aid or assistance under the State plan under this part for purposes of eligibility for any other program established under this Act.A child described in paragraph (2) for whom such services or programs under this subsection are provided for more than 6 months while in the home of a kin caregiver, and who would satisfy the AFDC eligibility requirement of section 472(a)(3)(A)(ii)(II) but for residing in the home of the caregiver for more than 6 months, is deemed to satisfy that requirement for purposes of determining whether the child is eligible for foster care maintenance payments under section 472.''.","cardTarget":"","label":"dE tVII stA pI

and in the case of a child placed in a qualified residential treatment program (as defined in paragraph (4)), the requirements specified in paragraph (3) and section 475A(c) are met.The settings for placement specified in this paragraph are the following: A qualified residential treatment program (as defined in paragraph (4)). A setting specializing in providing prenatal, post-partum, or parenting supports for youth. In the case of a child who has attained 18 years of age, a supervised setting in which the child is living independently. A setting providing high-quality residential care and supportive services to children and youth who have been found to be, or are at risk of becoming, sex trafficking victims, in accordance with section 471(a)(9)(C).In the case of a child who is placed in a qualified residential treatment program, if the assessment required under section 475A(c)(1) is not completed within 30 days after the placement is made, no Federal payment shall be made to the State under section 474(a)(1) for any amounts expended for foster care maintenance payments on behalf of the child during the placement.If the assessment required under section 475A(c)(1) determines that the placement of a child in a qualified residential treatment program is not appropriate, a court disapproves such a placement under section 475A(c)(2), or a child who has been in an approved placement in a qualified residential treatment program is going to return home or be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster family home, Federal payments shall be made to the State under section 474(a)(1) for amounts expended for foster care maintenance payments on behalf of the child while the child remains in the qualified residential treatment program only during the period necessary for the child to transition home or to such a placement. In no event shall a State receive Federal payments under section 474(a)(1) for amounts expended for foster care maintenance payments on behalf of a child who remains placed in a qualified residential treatment program after the end of the 30-day period that begins on the date a determination is made that the placement is no longer the recommended or approved placement for the child.For purposes of this part, the term 'qualified residential treatment program' means a program that— has a trauma-informed treatment model that is designed to address the needs, including clinical needs as appropriate, of children with serious emotional or behavioral disorders or disturbances and, with respect to a child, is able to implement the treatment identified for the child by the assessment of the child required under section 475A(c); subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), has registered or licensed nursing staff and other licensed clinical staff who— provide care within the scope of their practice as defined by State law; are on-site according to the treatment model referred to in subparagraph (A); and are available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week; to extent appropriate, and in accordance with the child’s best interests, facilitates participation of family members in the child’s treatment program; facilitates outreach to the family members of the child, including siblings, documents how the outreach is made (including contact information), and maintains contact information for any known biological family and fictive kin of the child; documents how family members are integrated into the treatment process for the child, including post-discharge, and how sibling connections are maintained; provides discharge planning and family-based aftercare support for at least 6 months post-discharge; and is licensed in accordance with section 471(a)(10) and is accredited by any of the following independent, not-for-profit organizations: The Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). The Council on Accreditation (COA).

prohibiting Federal payments for administrative expenditures incurred on behalf of a child placed in a child-care institution and for which payment is available under section 474(a)(3).The requirements in paragraph (4)(B) shall not be construed as requiring a qualified residential treatment program to acquire nursing and behavioral health staff solely through means of a direct employer

determine whether the needs of the child can be met with family members or through placement in a foster family home or, if not, which setting from among the settings specified in section 472(k)(2) would provide the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment and be consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child; and develop a list of child-specific short- and long-term mental and behavioral health goals. The State shall assemble a family and permanency team for the child in accordance with the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii). The qualified individual conducting the assessment required under subparagraph (A) shall work in conjunction with the family of, and permanency team for, the child while conducting and making the assessment. The family and permanency team shall consist of all appropriate biological family members, relative, and fictive kin of the child, as well as, as appropriate, professionals who are a resource to the family of the child, such as teachers, medical or mental health providers who have treated the child, or clergy. In the case of a child who has attained age 14, the family and permanency team shall include the members of the permanency planning team for the child that are selected by the child in accordance with section 475(5)(C)(iv). The State shall document in the child's case plan— the reasonable and good faith effort of the State to identify and include all the individuals described in clause (ii) on the child's family and permanency team; all contact information for members of the family and permanency team, as well as contact information for other family members and fictive kin who are not part of the family and permanency team; evidence that meetings of the family and permanency team, including meetings relating to the assessment required under subparagraph (A), are held at a time and place convenient for family; if reunification is the goal, evidence demonstrating that the parent from whom the child was removed provided input on the members of the family and permanency team; evidence that the assessment required under subparagraph (A) is determined in conjunction with the family and permanency team; the placement preferences of the family and permanency team relative to the assessment that recognizes children should be placed with their siblings unless there is a finding by the court that such placement is contrary to their best interest; and if the placement preferences of the family and permanency team and child are not the placement setting recommended by the qualified individual conducting the assessment under subparagraph (A), the reasons why the preferences of the team and of the child were not recommended. In the case of a child who the qualified individual conducting the assessment under subparagraph (A) determines should not be placed in a foster family home, the qualified individual shall specify in writing the reasons why the needs of the child cannot be met by the family of the child or in a foster family home. A shortage or lack of foster family homes shall not be an acceptable reason for determining that the needs of the child cannot be met in a foster family home. The qualified individual also shall specify in writing why the recommended placement in a qualified residential treatment program is the setting that will provide the child with the most effective and appropriate level of care in the least restrictive environment and how that placement is consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. Subject to clause (ii), in this subsection, the term 'qualified individual' means a trained professional or licensed clinician who is not an employee of the State agency and who is not connected to, or affiliated with, any placement setting in which children are placed by the State. The Secretary may approve a request of a State to waive any requirement in clause (i) upon a submission by the State, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, that certifies that the trained professionals or licensed clinicians with responsibility for performing the assessments described in subparagraph (A) shall maintain objectivity with respect to determining the most effective and appropriate placement for a child. Within 60 days of the start of each placement in a qualified residential treatment program, a family or juvenile court or another court (including a tribal court) of competent jurisdiction, or an administrative body appointed or approved by the court, independently, shall— consider the assessment, determination, and documentation made by the qualified individual conducting the assessment under paragraph (1); determine whether the needs of the child can be met through placement in a foster family home or, if not, whether placement of the child in a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment and whether that placement is consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child; and approve or disapprove the placement. The written documentation made under paragraph (1)(C) and documentation of the determination and approval or disapproval of the placement in a qualified residential treatment program by a court or administrative body under paragraph (2) shall be included in and made part of the case plan for the child. As long as a child remains placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the State agency shall submit evidence at each status review and each permanency hearing held with respect to the child— demonstrating that ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child continues to support the determination that the needs of the child cannot be met through placement in a foster family home, that the placement in a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment, and that the placement is consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child; documenting the specific treatment or service needs that will be met for the child in the placement and the length of time the child is expected to need the treatment or services; and documenting the efforts made by the State agency to prepare the child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster family home. In the case of any child who is placed in a qualified residential treatment program for more than 12 consecutive months or 18 nonconsecutive months (or, in the case of a child who has not attained age 13, for more than 6 consecutive or nonconsecutive months), the State agency shall submit to the Secretary— the most recent versions of the evidence and documentation specified in paragraph (4); and the signed approval of the head of the State agency for the continued placement of the child in that setting.''.","cardTarget":"/uslm/us/usc/t42/s675a","xml":"<section xmlns=\"http://xml.house.gov/schemas/uslm/1.0\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:dcterms=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742\" id=\"HD96562538D244DBFAD6F15C585855469\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"50742\">Sec. 50742.</num><heading> Assessment and documentation of the need for placement in a qualified residential treatment program</heading><p><p class=\"indent0\">Section 475A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 675a) is amended by adding at the end the following:</p></p><quotedContent id=\"H836359349F1341F5AA612F8BCE0C0038\"><subsection identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c\" id=\"HEA177E401F174FF49AD34330E38FC2FE\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"c\">''(c)</num><heading> Assessment, documentation, and judicial determination requirements for placement in a qualified residential treatment program.—</heading><chapeau>In the case of any child who is placed in a qualified residential treatment program (as defined in section 472(k)(4)), the following requirements shall apply for purposes of approving the case plan for the child and the case system review procedure for the child:</chapeau><paragraph identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c/1\" id=\"H208163F8BAF743C2A1BE41840F4DF85D\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"1\">''(1)</num><subparagraph identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c/1/A\" id=\"H745B523DF56048669C43004DBB4A32AD\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"A\">''(A)</num><chapeau> Within 30 days of the start of each placement in such a setting, a qualified individual (as defined in subparagraph (D)) shall—</chapeau><clause identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c/1/A/i\" id=\"HEB4B08CC5CB443BBB4BBE6A18BCE4CCD\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"i\">''(i)</num><content> assess the strengths and needs of the child using an age-appropriate, evidence-based, validated, functional assessment tool approved by the Secretary;</content></clause><clause identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c/1/A/ii\" id=\"H086C9319040B407DA7854C3534134CBA\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"ii\">''(ii)</num><content> determine whether the needs of the child can be met with family members or through placement in a foster family home or, if not, which setting from among the settings specified in section 472(k)(2) would provide the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment and be consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child; and</content></clause><clause identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c/1/A/iii\" id=\"H837EEC4F86E9467FB593FF9ED02CAEE9\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"iii\">''(iii)</num><content> develop a list of child-specific short- and long-term mental and behavioral health goals.</content></clause></subparagraph><subparagraph identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c/1/B\" id=\"H9037382B353E4DF39A345EDDC8C6C401\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"B\">''(B)</num><clause identifier=\"/dE/tVII/stA/pIV/s50742/qB/c/1/B/i\" id=\"HD14F870C94814F04A962037883A83EAD\" class=\"bill-dtd-OLC\" pagenum=\"194\"><num value=\"i\">''(i)</num><content> The State shall assemble a family and permanency team for the child in accordance with the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii).

of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.) is amended—Title XX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.) is amended— by adding at the end the following:The purposes of this subtitle are the following: To improve the lives of families and individuals in need in the United States by funding social programs that achieve real results. To redirect funds away from programs that, based on objective data, are ineffective, and into programs that achieve demonstrable, measurable results. To ensure Federal funds are used effectively on social services to produce positive outcomes for both service recipients and taxpayers. To establish the use of social impact partnerships to address some of our Nation’s most pressing problems.
